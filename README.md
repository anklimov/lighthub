# LightHub
is Flexible, Arduino-Mega/Arduino DUE/ESP8266 open-software and open-hardware SmartHome controller. [RU](https://geektimes.ru/post/295109/) [HOME-site RU](http://lazyhome.ru)
It may operate both: 
* On [especially designed hardware board](http://www.lazyhome.ru/index.php/featurerequest) with 16 optocoupled digital inputs, 16 ESD protected digital/analog Inputs/outputs, 8 open-collector outputs (up to 0.5A/50V), DMX IN/OUT, MODBUS RTU and hardware 1-wire support circuit.
* On plain Arduino MEGA 2560, Arduino DUE, ESP8266 and even on [Controllino](http://controllino.biz/)
(Controllino and ESP8266 is not tested enough and in experimental stage yet)

Lighthub allows connecting together:
* Contact sensors (switches, buttons etc)
* Analog sensors (Leak detectors, Knobs etc)
* 1-Wire temperature sensors (up to 20 on single bus)
* Standard nonexpensive Relay board with TTL inputs, [like this](http://ali.pub/2zlosh) to control AC powered lamps, floor heaters, boilers etc
* [Standard nonexpensive LED dimmers](http://ali.pub/2zlokp) and [AC DMX-512 dimmers](http://ali.pub/2zlont)
* Modbus RTU devices (Currently, are deployed two types of Modbus devices: AC Dimmer and Ventilation set (Based on [Vacon 10 controller](http://files.danfoss.com/download/Drives/Vacon-10-Quick-Guide-DPD00714F1-UK.pdf))
* Simple DMX wall sensor panel [like this](http://ali.pub/2zlohe)

Where is possible both, to configure local control/mapping between inputs and outputs (light, floor heating thermostats) and remote control from MQTT enabled software. At the moment, LightHub tested and perfectly working with following set of complementary free software:
* [Openhab or Openhab2 Smarthome software](http://www.openhab.org/)
Openhab provides own native mobile app both, for IoS and Android, and even allow you to use Apple's HomeKit and Google Home to say "Siri, turn on light in bedroom" or "Hey Google, set bedroom light to Red" but requires some server to be installed in-premises (Raspberry PI with [Openhabian](https://docs.openhab.org/installation/openhabian) will good enough)
* [HomeRemote mobile client](http://thehomeremote.com/)
Home Remote mobile applicatios for IoS and Android requires just MQTT broker to be working. Any Cloud-based MQTT broker, like [CloudMQTT](https://www.cloudmqtt.com/) will enough to serve average household, even with free account. 
* [Node-Red](https://nodered.org/)  Possibly, the best solution to deploy event-based authomation and scripting on top of MQTT/LightHub. The easy to use universal and visual tool to wire many different devices in single system. Having own Dashbord which allow control from web/mobile web, even without mobile apps (excelent co-working with OpenHab and HomeRemote)

Scalability of Lighthub is virtually unlimited: Setup so many controllers you needed in most convenient places of your house - MQTT broker will allow controllers communicate each other and with Openhab/NodeRed/HomeRemote and propagate commands across network.

# Platforms specific details:

**AVR** version (Arduino Mega) is basic, long time in production and have all functions
* DMX-out is software (DMXSimple) on pin3, can be re-defined to PIN 18 (USART1 TX)
* DMX-in - hardware
* WIZNET 5100 and 5500 Ethernets are supported
* Modbus on USART2

**SAM3X8E** (Arduino DUE): (Tested. In production. Recomended hardware at current moment)
* default PWM out frequency
* both, DMX-in and DMX-out are hardware USART based. Use USART1 (pins 18 and 19) for DMX-out and DMX-in
* WIZNET 5100 and 5500 Ethernets are supported
* Modbus on USART2

**ESP8266**: (Developed, working, but not tested in production)
* DMX-OUT on USART1 TX
* DMX-IN - disabled - not possible to deploy in ESP8266
* Modbus - disabled. Might be configured in future on USART0 instead CLI/DEBUG

**ESP32**, **NRF52840** : Still early development stage
